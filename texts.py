    Sven the Bartender: Hey %s!!! Get your drunk ass outta here! The saloon is closed.
    You lift your head up from the counter and try to remember what happened.
    You look around only to discover an almost emptied bottle of scotch on the counter in front of you.
    Just another one of those nights... You take another sip straight from the bottle.
    You: Uuh Sven, thank god you are here. Where am I?
    Unknown: In the wrong neighborhood, son.
    You turn around and see a dodgy man sitting by a table in the corner.
    There is a gun on the table.
    What do you do?""",
